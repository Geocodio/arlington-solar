        <p class="text-xl text-gray-200 my-2">The new Amazon-Arlington Solar Farm Virginia project is <span class="text-2xl tracking-wider">BIG</span>. Arlington is purchasing the power output from approximately 475 acres. That’s over 360 football fields of solar!</p>

        <p class="text-xl text-gray-200 my-2">This new solar electricity will go onto the grid and offset over 80% of the Arlington County government’s electricity use. Our streetlights and stoplights, fire stations, community centers, water treatment plant, Trades Center, County offices, and more.</p>

        <p class="text-xl text-gray-200 my-2">This is a huge step towards your Arlington County government using <a href="https://arlingtonva.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2019/10/Final-CEP-CLEAN-003.pdf" target="_blank">100% renewable electricity by 2025.</a></p>

        <p class="text-xl text-gray-200 my-2">The farm may be in Pittsylvania County, but if it were in Arlington, just how big would it be?</p>
